## Time Series Analysis with Auto ARIMA

This project aims to provide an automated approach for time series forecasting using the Auto ARIMA algorithm. Auto ARIMA is a popular algorithm for time series analysis and forecasting, as it automatically determines the optimal parameters for an ARIMA model.

### Overview
In this project, we focus on forecasting future values of a given time series using the Auto ARIMA algorithm. The steps involved in the project are as follows:

- Data Preparation: We start by collecting and pre-processing the time series data. This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and ensuring the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): After data preparation, we perform exploratory data analysis to understand the patterns, trends, and seasonality present in the time series. EDA helps us gain insights into the data and identify any anomalies.

- Model Building: The next step is to build an Auto ARIMA model. Auto ARIMA automatically identifies the optimal order (p, d, q) for an ARIMA model based on statistical criteria. We demonstrate how to use this algorithm to build the model and make predictions.

- Model Evaluation: Once the model is built, we evaluate its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and others. Model evaluation helps us assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

- Forecasting: After evaluating the model, we demonstrate how to use it to make future predictions based on the learned patterns in the time series. These predictions can provide valuable insights for decision-making.
